      <h4>Hello there. You have stumbled upon Quinn's nascent github.io presence. Here's some stuff they've built.</h4>
    </div>
    <ul id="link-list">
      <li><a href="/med-calc/index.html"><b>Med Calc</b></a> is a tool that projects how long your supply of injectable medication will last.</li>
      <li><a href="/radio/index.html"><b>Better Late, Whatever.</b></a> is a radio show they host on WXDU.</li>
      <li><a href="/last-week-classic/index.html"><b>Last Week</b></a> allows you to type in your last.fm username and then see at a glance who your friends have been listening to the most over the past seven days.</li>
      <li><b>The Past Times of The Postmodern American Pastime</b> will be a tool (possibly leveraging the cypher that is the ESPN fantasy sports API, or maybe just clunkily page-scraping) providing a detailed history of a truly iconic 10-team fantasy baseball league, soon beginning its 14th season.</li>
    </ul>
